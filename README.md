# Matchismo Project
This is the code for the _Matchismo_ project for the Computer Science [CS139p](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p) course *"Developing Apps for iPhone and iPad Winter 2013"* (January / March) by Stanford University on [iTunes U](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016?l=en).

## Lecture(s)
This code covers the _Matchismo_ project from Lecture 2

## Versions
The code has been tagged in different versions, where the major version relates to a certain lecture and the minor version relates to an iteration in the code of a particular lecture (slides, live demonstration, assignment and fixes), but is not the *literal* number of the Lecture. The way the code has been tagged is as follows:

Tag | Lecture | What
--- | --- | ---
v0.1.0-Lecture2-Demonstration | `Lecture 2` | *The code from the Live Demonstration*
v0.1.1-Lecture2-Slides | `Lecture 2` | *The code from the lecture slides*
v0.1.2-Lecture2-Assignment | `Lecture 2` | *The code developed for the assignments*
v0.1.3-Lecture2-Fixes | `Lecture 2` | *Fixes made after the solution was posted*

This way you can _download_ each stage of development, for example the stage _before_ I add my solution of the assignments, and implement your own solution.
